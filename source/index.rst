GnuCash is the personal finance software package made for you. It is
versatile enough to keep track of all your financial information, from
the simple to the very complex. It is one of the few financial software
packages that supports global currencies, and it is the only open-source
program of its kind. Best of all, GnuCash is easy to learn and use!

So, what can GnuCash do for you? It can keep track of your personal
finances in as much detail as you prefer. If you are just starting out,
use GnuCash to keep track of your checkbook. You may then decide to
track cash as well as credit card purchases to better determine where
your money is being spent. When you start investing, you can use GnuCash
to help monitor your portfolio. Buying a vehicle or a home? GnuCash will
help you plan the investment and track loan payments. If your financial
records span the globe, GnuCash provides all the multiple-currency
support you need.

While GnuCash is well suited for personal finances, it is also powerful
enough for business use. There are many business features, from
integrated accounts receivable and payable systems, to tax table
construction. You will find these and the many other business features
surprisingly powerful and easy to use.

Easy to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~

Within a matter of minutes you will be able to enter your personal
finance information and generate color graphs that represent your
financial status. If you can use the register in the back of your

between fields, and use quick-fill to automatically complete
transactions. The interface is customizable from within the application
itself.

   Interface Guidelines. This means that they are simple and similar in
   appearance to many other GNOME applications.

   documentation.

-  *Import Methods*: GnuCash supports many ways to input transactions
   besides manual entry. If you can access your bank accounts on-line,

   support one of the following import methods. You will spend less time
   entering data and more time analyzing results.

      Computer Interface protocol. This protocol includes statement

      possible.

-  *Reports*: GnuCash comes with over 30 prebuilt reports, including
   Account Summary, Income, Expenses, Transaction Report, Balance Sheet,
   Profit&Loss, Portfolio Valuation, and many others. Reports support
   graphical views of the data, including pie charts, bar charts, and
   scatter plots. The reports can be exported to HTML files, and are
   easily customized.

   automatically create and enter transactions, or remind you when these
   transactions are due, giving you the choice of entering, postponing
   or removing the automated transaction.

   payment loan scheduled transaction.

-  *Easy Account Reconciliation*: Integrated reconciliation makes
   reconciling your GnuCash accounts with statements simple and

Tracks Your Investments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GnuCash includes a number of investment features that allow you to track
all your investments. With GnuCash you can track stocks individually
(one per account) or in a portfolio of accounts (a group of accounts
that can be displayed together).

GnuCash supports online stock and mutual fund quotes. This means you no
longer need to look up stock prices one at a time. The process can be
automated, and you can see the latest value of your stocks.

.. _oview-featuresintl2:

International Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GnuCash is truly an application that works with and understands users
from all around the world. There are many built-in features to
facilitate interaction with the international world we live in today.

-  *Native Languages*: GnuCash has been translated into 56 languages.
   The best ones, with over 90% translated, are Croatian, German,
   Hebrew, Portuguese, Spanish, and Ukrainian. Almost as good, with over
   80% translated, are Catalan, Dutch, Japanese, Latvian, Russian,
   Serbian, and Turkish.  [1]_

-  *International Format Handling*: GnuCash understands that different
   countries display the date and numbers differently. You are able to
   work with the date and number formats you are accustomed to.

-  *Multiple Currencies and Currency Trading*: Multiple currencies are
   supported and can be bought and sold (traded). Currency movements
   between accounts remain fully balanced if "Trading Accounts" is
   enabled.

-  *On-line exchange rates*: With GnuCash, you no longer need look up
   your exchange rates one at a time. The process can be automated, to
   always present you with the account values converted to your
   preferred currency using the latest exchange rates.

.. _oview-featuresbus2:

Business Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GnuCash has many features to support the needs of the business
accounting community.

-  *Accounts Receivable/Payable*: GnuCash has an integrated Accounts
   Receivable and Accounts Payable system. You can track Customers,
   Vendors, Invoicing and Bill Payment, and use different Tax and
   Billing Terms in a small business.

-  *Depreciation*: GnuCash can track depreciation of capital assets.

-  *Reports*: GnuCash offers a wide variety of ready-to-use business
   reports.

.. _oview-featuresaccounting2:

Accounting Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those knowledgeable in accounting, here is a list of GnuCash’s
accounting features.

-  *Double Entry*: Every transaction must debit one account and credit
   others by an equal amount. This ensures the “books balance” - that
   the difference between income and expense exactly equals the sum of
   all bank, cash, stock and other assets.

-  *Split Transactions*: A single transaction can be split into several
   pieces to record taxes, fees, and other compound entries.

-  *Chart of Accounts*: A master account can have a hierarchy of detail
   accounts underneath it. This allows similar account types such as
   Cash, Bank, or Stock to be grouped into a master account such as
   “Assets”.

-  *General Journal*: One register window can display multiple accounts
   at the same time. This eases the trouble of tracking down
   typing/entry errors. It also provides a convenient way of viewing a
   portfolio of many stocks, by showing all transactions in that
   portfolio.

-  *Income/Expense Account Types (Categories)*: These categorize your
   cash flow and, when used properly with the double-entry feature, will
   provide an accurate Profit&Loss statement.

About this Book
---------------

This manual’s goal is to save you time. It will get you started using
GnuCash as quickly as possible.

Each chapter follows a simple format. A chapter begins with a “Concepts”
discussion which introduces general themes and terminology, addressed
and used within that chapter. “How-To” sections, which address specific
procedures follow. Finally, a “Putting It All Together” section ends the
chapter by giving detailed, concrete examples.

Beginning users will find the “Concepts” sections very helpful. They
provide a reference for good ways to track your finances, and serve as a
general introduction to financial background and terminology.
Experienced users can flip to the “How-To” sections to quickly scan
procedures. These sections provide to-the-point steps for accomplishing
specific tasks. The “Putting It All Together” sections present
real-world examples in the form of a tutorial. Beginning with creation
of a file in :ref:`chapter_basics`, each successive chapter builds
on the previous chapter’s tutorial.
