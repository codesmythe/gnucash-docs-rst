How can I use this document offline?

## Purpose:

- Allow Read the Docs files to be viewed offline

- Make edits to the docs themselves and render them locally so you can inspect changes before pushing back to the fork

## Install:

- Python 3.7.6 - Note: current bug in v3.8

- pip install Sphinx

- pip install sphinx-autobuild

- pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

- Download https://github.com/codesmythe/gnucash-docs-rst/archive/master.zip from a fork of your choice and Unzip to a directory

## Run:

### Windows
- Navigate to the directory in Explorer and on the address bar enter make livehtml to start the local server

 - In your browser enter http://127.0.0.1:8000

If you make any changes to the local User Manual files they will be updated in the browser.
