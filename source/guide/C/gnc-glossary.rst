.. glossary::

   Account
       An account keeps track of what you own, owe, spend or receive.

   Accounting Period
       An accounting period is the period with reference to which accounting
       books of an entity are prepared. Common accounting periods include
       month, quarter, and year.

   AqBanking
       A library which implements the German Home Banking Computer Interface
       (HBCI) and Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard (EBICS),
       OFX Direct Connect and Paypal. It is the successor of openHBCI.

   Asset
      An asset is something you own. Anything tangible or intangible that can
      be owned or controlled to produce value and that is held to have
      positive economic value is considered an asset.

   Balance Sheet
      A Balance Sheet is a summary of the financial balances of an individual
      or organization. It summarizes a company's assets, liabilities and
      ownership equity at a specific point in time.

   Book
      A book is a record of all transactions for an individual or
      organization. In GnuCash, each file contains a book.

   Capital Gain/Loss
      The difference between the purchase and selling prices of an investment
      at the time the investment is sold. Also known as *Realized Gain/Loss*.
      Before an investment is sold, the difference in value is referred to as
      *Unrealized Gain/Loss*.

      See also Realized Gain/Loss.

      See also Unrealized Gain/Loss.

   Capital stock
      See Stock.

   Chart of Accounts
      A listing of all the accounts available in the data file. The chart of
      accounts consists of balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities,
      stockholders' equity) and income statement accounts (revenues, expenses,
      gains, losses).

   Commission
      The fee paid to a broker to buy or sell securities.

   Commodity
      A commodity is something of value that is easily tradeable or sellable;
      for example, currencies, stocks, bonds, grain, copper, and oil are all
      commodities.

   Common stock
      See Stock.

   Compounding
      The concept that the reinvested interest can later earn interest of its
      own (interest on interest). This is often referred to as *compound
      interest*.

   Cost Basis
      Cost basis is the original cost of property, adjusted for various
      factors. Its primary use is for tax purposes. Factors that affect the
      cost basis include: stock splits, dividends, depreciation and return of
      capital distributions. Cost basis is used to determine the *capital
      gain*.

   CSV
      Stands for Comma Separated Values. CSV files are used to store data in
      plain text. Each line of the file is a record and each record can be
      comprised of multiple fields separated by commas. CSV is one import
      format that GnuCash supports.

   Dividends
      Dividends are cash payments a company makes to shareholders. The amount
      of this payment is usually determined as some amount of the profits of
      the company. Not all common stocks give dividends.

   Equities
      Equities are investments in which the investor becomes part (or whole)
      owner in something.

   Financial Transaction Services (FinTS)
      A banking protocol used by German banks. Developed by the German Central
      Banking Committee ZKA (Zentraler Kredit-Ausschuss). The standard is used
      only by German banks. Prior 2002, it was called Home Banking Computer
      Interface (HBCI). FinTS is one import format that GnuCash supports.

      See also Home Computer Banking Interface (HBCI).

   GSettings
      Since version 2.5 the tool that stores user configuration data. It uses
      the native data store of the operating system:

      *Linux*
         DConf since Gnome 3.0 dropped GConf

      *MacOS*
         Defaults. Use the command-line defaults(1) to modify prefs when
         GnuCash isn't running.

      *Windows*
         Registry.

   Home Computer Banking Interface (HBCI)
      A bank-independent online banking protocol used by German banks. Home
      Banking Computer Interface (HBCI) was developed by the German Central
      Banking Committee ZKA (Zentraler Kredit-Ausschuss). Since 2002, it has
      been called Financial Transaction Services (FinTS). HBCI is one import
      format that GnuCash supports.

      See also Financial Transaction Services (FinTS).

   Interest
      What a borrower pays a lender for the use of their money. Normally, this
      is expressed in terms of a percentage of the principal per year. For
      example, a savings account with 1% interest will pay you $1 for every
      $100 you keep deposited per year.

   Liability
      A liability is a debt or obligation that an individual or organization
      owes.

   LibOFX
      An open source library for *OFX*. It was created by one of the GnuCash
      developers, originally to be the OFX interface for GnuCash.

      See also OFX.

   Liquidity
      A measure of how easily convertible an investment is to cash. Money in a
      savings account is very liquid, while money invested in a house has low
      liquidity because it takes time to sell a house.

   Lot
      A lot is a means of grouping a commodity so that you later identify that
      the item bought in one transaction is the same as one sold in a
      different transaction. Lots are often implemented with stocks, where
      capital gain can depend on which item is being sold at a given time.

   MT940
      A financial information standard defined by SWIFT and used by several
      European banks. It is also used internally in HBCI. Unfortunately, you
      can't download the MT940 standard, but some banks publish it on their
      websites. MT940 is one import format that GnuCash supports.

   OFX
      The Open Financial eXchange format. This is a financial information
      exchange standard used by many institutions. OFX is one import format
      that GnuCash supports.

   Price Database
      The price database contains a store of price quotes for stocks, mutual
      funds, and currencies.

   Principal
      The original amount of money invested or borrowed.

   QFX
      The Quicken Financial eXchange format is a proprietary financial
      information exchange standard promoted by Quicken and used by many
      institutions. QFX is one import format that GnuCash supports.

   QIF
      The Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) is an open specification for
      reading and writing financial data to files. This is an older format
      that is still used by many institutions. QIF is one import format that
      GnuCash supports.

   Realized Gain/Loss
      The difference between the purchase and selling prices of an investment
      at the time the investment is sold. Also known as *Capital Gain/Loss*.
      Before an investment is sold, the difference in value is referred to as
      *Unrealized Gain/Loss*.

      See also Capital Gain/Loss.

     See also Unrealized Gain/Loss.

   Reconciliation
      Reconciliation is a verification process in which the user compares
      their records with those of the financial institution to ensure that the
      records in each system agree at some particular point in time. During
      reconciliation, the user checks individual transactions in their file
      against the institution's statement; upon completion, the reported
      balances of the institution and the reconciled account will match at
      that point in the register.

   Return
      The total income plus capital gains or losses of an investment.

      See also Yield.

   Reversing Transaction
      In formal accounting, a transaction is never deleted. Therefore, when a
      mistake is made, the original transaction remains in the ledger, and a
      transaction is added to the ledger that reverses the original. This
      *reversing transaction* duplicates the original transaction, but with
      debit and credit amounts reversed. This removes the effect of the
      erroneous transaction from the books. After entering the reversing
      transaction, a corrected transaction can then be entered. Reversing
      transactions are not commonly used in personal accounting.

   Risk
      The probability that the return on investment is different from what was
      expected. Investments are often grouped on a scale from low risk (e.g.,
      savings accounts or government bonds) to high risk (e.g., common stocks
      or junk bonds). As a general rule of thumb, the higher the risk, the
      higher the possible return.

   Scheduled Transaction
      Scheduled transactions provide a framework for remembering information
      about transactions that are set to occur in the future, either once or
      periodically.

      See also Yield.

   Scheme
      Scheme is a functional programming language based on a dialect of LISP.
      Reports in GnuCash use the Scheme programming language; thus, users
      wishing to customize reports must write Scheme.

   Shareholder
      A shareholder is a person who holds common stock in a company.

   Split
      A split, or Ledger Entry, is the fundamental accounting unit. Each split
      consists of an amount, the value of that amount expressed in a
      (possibly) different currency, a Memo, a pointer to the parent
      Transaction, a pointer to the debited Account, a reconciled flag and
      timestamp, an action field, and a key-value frame which can store
      arbitrary data.

   Stock
      A security that represents a certain fractional ownership of a company.
      This is what you buy when you “buy stock” in a company on the open
      market. This is also sometimes known as *capital stock*, or *common
      stock*.

   Stock split
      Occurs when a company offers to issue some additional multiple of shares
      for each existing stock. For example, a “2 for 1” stock split means that
      if you own 100 shares of a stock, you will receive an additional 100
      shares at no cost to you. The unit price of the shares will usually be
      adjusted so there is no net change in the value, so in this example the
      price per share will be halved. Note that such transactions affect the
      cost basis per share owned.

   Transaction
      A transaction consists of a date, a description, an ID number, a list of
      two or more splits, and a key-value frame. Transactions embody the
      notion of "double entry" accounting.

   Unrealized Gain/Loss
      Unrealized gain or loss is the difference in value between a purchase
      price and the current value of a given asset. These gains remain
      unrealized until the asset is sold, at which point they become *Realized
      gains or losses*.

      See also Capital Gain/Loss.

      See also Realized Gain/Loss.

   Valuation
      The process of determining the market value or the price the investment
      would sell at in a “reasonable time frame”.

   XML
      The eXtensible Markup Language is an international markup standard.
      GnuCash stores its data by default in an XML data structure.

   Yield
      A measure of the amount of money you earn from an investment (i.e., how
      much income you receive from the investment). Typically, this is
      reported as a percentage of the principal amount. Yield does not include
      capital gains or losses (see Return). For example, a stock that sells
      for $100 and gives $2 in dividends per year has a yield of 2%.
